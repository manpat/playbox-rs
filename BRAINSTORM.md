Labyrinth - just several levels of increasingly convoluted mazes, get to the end
	- easy, doable with what I have now, but kinda meh

something with blood/salt
	- both limited resources
	- blood serves as both currency for rituals and as health

something with breadcrumbs
	- method of navigating labyrinth

be followed through labyrinth by entities
	- need to either lose them or fend them off with salt or blood rituals
	- e.g., long floating worm with fuzzy particle body.

find items to open doors?

something with altars

something with fire/candles
	- lighting candles different ways could have an effect. e.g., with different implements, or after certain actions
	- incense could play a role?

find items to do rituals?
	- why?
	- to aid navigation?
		- e.g., waypoints that let you find your way back
		- or summon smth to guide you to something important or help you find something
		- maybe player can create connections between different parts of the world by marking walls?
	- to break seals (open doors)
		- still opening doors, but maybe it can be made more interesting than just a fetch quest for a keycard
		- if there are ways the player can influence the outcome of a ritual (i.e. if there are multiple paths to take in a ritual), then this breaks away from the cliche
	- to create seals?
		- finding a way to make closing a path be the goal might be interesting

find items to make areas navigable?
	- lantern to clear a fog/light a path
	- something to lessen the harm of a poisonous/cursed haze

maybe some items can be traded with npcs or at altars?
	- force player to trade in useful item (e.g., lantern) for another that opens a path.
		- player must work harder to traverse previous areas but can enter others
	- same as above but maybe npc provides a service?
		- item can only be retrieved by killing them
